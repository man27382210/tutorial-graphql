# What is Redux ?

**[Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)** is a state management tool for JavaScript applications.
While it is frequently used with React, it is compatible with many other React-like frameworks such as [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) as well as Angular and even just plain JavaScript.
The main concept behind Redux is that the entire state of an application is stored in one central location.
Each component of an application can have direct access to the state of the application without having to send props down to child components or using callback functions to send data back up to a parent.
